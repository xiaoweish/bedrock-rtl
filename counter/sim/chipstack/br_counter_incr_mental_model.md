### SUMMARY

#### Module Instantiation Hierarchy:
- br_counter_incr

#### Module Summary Table:
| Module | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| br_counter_incr (Top Level) | The `br_counter_incr` module is designed to implement an incrementing counter in SystemVerilog. Its primary functionality is to increment a counter by a specified amount each clock cycle, with the ability to handle overflows by wrapping around at a defined maximum value. The module also supports reinitialization to a specified initial value and can accommodate increments during reinitialization. |

### Clock Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|clk|The type of this port is: logic.  The clock functionality of port `clk` is rising edge (posedge) triggered.|

### Reset Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|rst|The type of this port is: logic.  The reset functionality of the port `rst` is an active-high reset. When `rst` is asserted high, the counter is reset synchronously on the rising edge of `clk`. This means that the counter will be set to initial_value on the next clock cycle after `rst` is asserted. Users of the design would interact with the `rst` signal by driving it high to reset the counter and low to allow normal operation.|

### Input Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|reinit|The type of this port is: logic.  **Input Functionality of Port `reinit`:**  - **Purpose:** The `reinit` port is used to reset the counter to a specified `initial_value`. - **Type:** `logic`, active-high signal. - **Interaction:** When `reinit` is asserted (set high), the counter will be reinitialized to the `initial_value` in the next clock cycle. - **Behavior:** If `reinit` is high, the counter disregards the current `value`. - **Concurrent Operation:** If both `reinit` and `incr_valid` are high, the counter applies the increment to the `initial_value` rather than the current value. - **Effect on `value_next`:** When `reinit` is high, `value_next` reflects the `initial_value` (or `initial_value` plus `incr` if `incr_valid` is also high) for the next cycle.|
|initial_value|The type of this port is: logic[ValueWidth-1:0].  The `initial_value` port is used to set the starting value of the counter when the `reinit` signal is asserted. It determines the value to which the counter resets. When `reinit` is high, the counter will be set to `initial_value` in the next cycle, regardless of the current counter state. This port is crucial for reinitializing the counter to a known state, ensuring predictable behavior after a reset operation. The `initial_value` must always be less than or equal to the `MaxValue`.|
|incr_valid|The type of this port is: logic.  The `incr_valid` port is a control signal that determines whether the counter should be incremented. When `incr_valid` is high, the counter will be incremented by the value specified in the `incr` input during the next clock cycle. If `incr_valid` is low, the counter will hold its current value unless the `reinit` signal is high. This port is crucial for enabling the increment operation and ensuring that the counter updates correctly based on the provided increment value.|
|incr|The type of this port is: logic[IncrementWidth-1:0].  **Port: `incr`**  - **Functionality**: Specifies the increment value for the counter. - **Interaction**: Users set `incr` to determine how much the counter should increase when `incr_valid` is high. - **Expected Behavior**: When `incr_valid` is asserted, the counter will increase by the value of `incr` in the next cycle. - **Constraints**: The value of `incr` must be between 0 and `MaxIncrement` inclusive. - **Interesting Behavior**: If `incr` is set to 0, the counter will hold its current value even if `incr_valid` is high.|

### Output Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|value|The type of this port is: logic[ValueWidth-1:0].  - The `value` port represents the current state of the counter. - It updates with a latency of one cycle after a valid increment or reinitialization. - Upon reset, `value` is set to `initial_value` in the next cycle. - When `reinit` is high, `value` is set to `initial_value` in the next cycle. - When `incr_valid` is high, `value` increments by `incr` in the next cycle, wrapping around if necessary. - If both `reinit` and `incr_valid` are low, `value` holds its current state.|
|value_next|The type of this port is: logic[ValueWidth-1:0].  - `value_next` represents the counter's next state, updated based on `incr_valid` and `incr`. - When `incr_valid` is high, `value_next` reflects the incremented counter value. - If `reinit` is high, `value_next` is set to `initial_value` before applying any increment. - When both `reinit` and `incr_valid` are low, `value_next` equals the current `value`.|

### Design Parameters
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|MaxValue|The type of this parameter is: int.  **MaxValue Configuration Parameter**  - **Purpose**: Defines the maximum value the counter can reach before wrapping around to zero. It sets the upper limit for the counter's range.|
|MaxIncrement|The type of this parameter is: int.  - **Purpose of the parameter**: The configuration parameter `MaxIncrement` defines the maximum allowable increment value for the counter. It ensures that any increment applied to the counter does not exceed this specified limit, thereby controlling the maximum step size by which the counter can increase in a single cycle.|

### Basic Functionality
|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Reinitialize the counter|The goal of this operation is to reset the counter to a specified initial value. This operation is triggered when the `reinit` control signal is high. During this operation, the counter will be set to the `initial_value` input. The expected behavior is that the counter will be reinitialized in the next cycle after the `reinit` signal is asserted.|
|Increment the counter|The purpose of this operation is to increase the counter by a specified increment value. This operation occurs when the `incr_valid` control signal is high. The counter will be incremented by the value specified in the `incr` input. The increment operation will take effect in the next cycle after the `incr_valid` signal is asserted.|
|Hold the current counter value|This operation aims to maintain the current counter value without any changes. It is executed when both `reinit` and `incr_valid` control signals are low. In this scenario, the counter will hold its current value, and no changes will occur. The counter value will remain the same in the next cycle.|

### End-to-End Functionality
|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Sequential Increment and Reinitialize|Increment the counter by a specified value, then reinitialize the counter to a given initial value, and repeat the sequence. The control signals are adjusted to first perform the increment operation, followed by the reinitialization, allowing the counter to cycle through increments and reinits in a controlled manner.|
|Continuous Increment with Conditional Reinitialize|Continuously increment the counter by a specified value while monitoring for a condition to trigger reinitialization. The control signals are set to maintain continuous increments, with a conditional check to reinitialize the counter when a specific condition is met, enabling dynamic control of the counter's state based on external conditions.|

### Corner Case Functionality
|Condition|Expected Behavior|Handling Mechanism|
|---|---|---|
|Increment causes overflow|`value_next` becomes `(value + incr) % (MaxValue + 1)`|The design wraps around the counter value using modulo operation to handle overflow.|
|Increment is zero|`value_next` remains equal to `value`|The design maintains the current counter value when the increment is zero.|
|Increment is maximum|`value_next` is calculated based on the sum of `value` and `MaxIncrement`|The design adds the maximum increment value to the current counter value.|
|Reinitialization with increment|`value_next` is calculated as `initial_value + incr`|The design reinitializes the counter to `initial_value` and adds the increment if applicable.|

### Error Scenarios
|Error Scenario|Detection Mechanism|System Response|Recovery Actions|
|---|---|---|---|
|`incr` exceeds `MaxIncrement` when `incr_valid` is high.|The design uses assertions to detect if `incr` exceeds `MaxIncrement` when `incr_valid` is high.|The system does not have an automatic response mechanism for these errors. The assertions are meant for verification purposes and do not alter the behavior of the design during operation.|No automatic recovery actions are implemented within the design. Recovery would require external intervention to correct the input values.|
