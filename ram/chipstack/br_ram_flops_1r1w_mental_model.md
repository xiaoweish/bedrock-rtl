#### Module Summary Table:
| Module | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| br_ram_flops_1r1w (Top Level) | The `br_ram_flops_1r1w` module is a highly parameterized, flop-based RAM designed to support one-read/one-write (1R1W) operations, also known as pseudo-dual-port RAM. Its primary functionality is to provide a configurable memory structure with pipelined tiles, allowing for flexible depth and width configurations, optional read-after-write hazard bypass, and memory reset capabilities. |
| br_delay_valid | The `br_delay_valid` module is designed to delay a valid input signal by a specified number of clock cycles, determined by the `NumStages` parameter. Its primary functionality is to manage a pipeline of registers that delay both the data and its validity signal, ensuring that the output reflects the input after the specified delay, with the valid status of each stage being tracked and outputted. |
| br_ram_addr_decoder | The `br_ram_addr_decoder` module is designed to decode and direct an input address and data to one of several output tiles based on the most-significant bits of the address. Its primary functionality is to manage address decoding for RAMs of any depth (greater than or equal to 2) and distribute the data to a specified number of output tiles, with optional pipelining stages to control latency. |
| br_ram_flops_1r1w_tile | The `br_ram_flops_1r1w_tile` module is a SystemVerilog implementation of a one-read/one-write (1R1W) flop-based RAM tile, also known as pseudo-dual-port RAM. Its primary functionality is to provide a memory structure with zero-cycle read latency and one-cycle write latency, with an optional bypass feature that allows for zero-cycle write-to-read latency when the read and write ports access the same address simultaneously. |
| br_ram_data_rd_pipe | The `br_ram_data_rd_pipe` module is designed to manage the read data pipeline for RAM, facilitating the concatenation and multiplexing of data across specified depth and width dimensions. Its primary functionality is to handle the valid signals and data from multiple tiles, ensuring that the data is correctly pipelined and outputted with the appropriate latency, as determined by the depth and width stages parameters. |

### Reset Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|rst|<br> **Reset polarity:** active-high|

### Input Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|wr_valid|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `wr_valid` port indicates when a write operation to the RAM is requested.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules set `wr_valid` to 1 to initiate a write operation, alongside providing valid `wr_addr` and `wr_data`.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**: When `wr_valid` is 1, the RAM attempts to write `wr_data` to the address specified by `wr_addr`. If `wr_valid` is 0, no write operation occurs.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**: If `wr_valid` is 1 while `rd_addr_valid` is also 1, the RAM can perform simultaneous read and write operations, with the read data potentially reflecting the write data depending on the `TileEnableBypass` setting.|
|wr_addr|**Type:** `logic[AddressWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `wr_addr` port specifies the address in the RAM where data will be written.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users provide an address through `wr_addr` when `wr_valid` is asserted, indicating a write operation.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**: When `wr_valid` is high, the address specified by `wr_addr` is used to determine the RAM location for writing `wr_data`. The address must be within the range defined by `Depth`.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**: If `wr_valid` is low, the `wr_addr` value is ignored, and no write operation occurs. The address width is determined by `AddressWidth`, which is calculated based on `Depth`.|
|wr_data|**Type:** `logic[       Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `wr_data` port is used to input data that will be written to the RAM.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users provide data to be stored in the RAM through the `wr_data` port when a write operation is initiated by setting `wr_valid` to 1.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**: When `wr_valid` is 1, the data on `wr_data` is written to the address specified by `wr_addr`. The width of the data is determined by the `Width` parameter, allowing for flexible data sizes.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**: The data provided on `wr_data` is subject to pipelining and tiling configurations, which can affect the timing and latency of the write operation.|
|rd_addr_valid|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `rd_addr_valid` port indicates the validity of the read address, signaling when a read operation should be initiated.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules set `rd_addr_valid` to `1` to request a read operation from the RAM at the address specified by `rd_addr`.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**: When `rd_addr_valid` is `1`, the RAM processes the read request, and `rd_data_valid` and `rd_data` are updated after the read latency. If `rd_addr_valid` is `0`, no read operation occurs, and the output remains unchanged.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**: When both `rd_addr_valid` and `wr_valid` are `1`, simultaneous read and write operations occur, potentially affecting the read data depending on the `TileEnableBypass` setting.|
|rd_addr|**Type:** `logic[AddressWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `rd_addr` port specifies the address from which data is to be read from the RAM.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users provide an address through `rd_addr` when `rd_addr_valid` is asserted, indicating a read request.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**: When `rd_addr_valid` is high, the address on `rd_addr` is used to access the corresponding data in the RAM. The data is then output on `rd_data` after a delay determined by `ReadDataDepthStages` and `ReadDataWidthStages`.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**: If `TileEnableBypass` is set to 1 and `wr_valid` is also high with `wr_addr` equal to `rd_addr`, the read operation can return the newly written data without delay.|

### Output Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|rd_data_valid|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: Indicates the validity of the data present on the `rd_data` port.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor `rd_data_valid` to determine when the data on `rd_data` is valid and ready for use.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `rd_addr_valid` is asserted, `rd_data_valid` will be asserted after a delay determined by `ReadDataDepthStages` and `ReadDataWidthStages`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `rd_data_valid = 0`.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `TileEnableBypass` is set to 1, `rd_data_valid` may assert with zero-cycle latency when read and write addresses are equal and valid simultaneously.|
|rd_data|**Type:** `logic[       Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `rd_data` serves as the output port for read data from the RAM.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules read the value from `rd_data` after initiating a read operation by setting `rd_addr_valid` to 1.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `rd_addr_valid` is 1, `rd_data` outputs the data stored at the address specified by `rd_addr` after a delay determined by `ReadDataDepthStages` and `ReadDataWidthStages`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, if `EnableMemReset` is 1, `rd_data` is set to 0; otherwise, it remains undefined until written.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `TileEnableBypass` is 1 and a read and write occur at the same address simultaneously, `rd_data` reflects the new write data immediately.|

### Design Parameters
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Depth|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `Depth` parameter defines the number of entries in the RAM, determining its storage capacity. It must be at least 2 and influences the address width, calculated as the logarithm base 2 of `Depth`. This parameter affects the configuration of the RAM's address space and the range of valid addresses for read and write operations. Users interact with it by setting its value to match the desired memory size, ensuring it aligns with the design's constraints and requirements.|
|Width|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `Width` parameter defines the bitwidth of each entry in the RAM. It determines how many bits of data can be stored in each memory location. Users can configure this parameter to match the data width requirements of their application, ensuring that each memory entry can accommodate the necessary amount of data. The `Width` must be at least 1 and should be evenly divisible by `WidthTiles`, which affects how the memory is tiled and pipelined. Adjusting the `Width` impacts the overall data capacity and the organization of the memory structure.|
|DepthTiles|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `DepthTiles` parameter determines the number of tiles along the depth dimension of the RAM. It must be at least 1 and evenly divide the `Depth` parameter. This parameter is crucial for configuring how the RAM's depth is partitioned into smaller, manageable sections or tiles. Adjusting `DepthTiles` affects the distribution of address decoding and the organization of memory storage, influencing the RAM's performance and resource utilization.|
|WidthTiles|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `WidthTiles` parameter configures the number of tiles along the width dimension of the RAM. It determines how the total bit width (`Width`) is divided among multiple tiles, ensuring that the width is evenly distributed. This parameter allows for flexible memory organization and can impact the design's performance and resource utilization by controlling the granularity of data distribution across the RAM structure.|
|AddressDepthStages|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `AddressDepthStages` parameter determines the number of pipeline register stages inserted along the write and read address paths in the depth dimension of the RAM. It controls the latency of address processing, allowing users to adjust the timing of address propagation through the RAM. By configuring this parameter, users can optimize the balance between speed and resource usage, influencing how quickly the RAM can respond to address changes.|
|ReadDataDepthStages|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `ReadDataDepthStages` parameter configures the number of pipeline stages inserted along the read data path in the depth dimension of the RAM. It determines the latency of the read operation by specifying how many clock cycles the read data is delayed before being output. This parameter allows users to adjust the timing characteristics of the read path to meet specific design requirements, such as balancing throughput and latency.|
|ReadDataWidthStages|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `ReadDataWidthStages` parameter specifies the number of pipeline register stages inserted along the read data path in the width dimension. It controls the latency of the read data output (`rd_data`) by determining how many cycles the data is delayed as it is processed through the pipeline. Adjusting this parameter allows users to manage the timing and synchronization of read data across different width tiles, optimizing performance based on specific design requirements.|
|TileEnableBypass|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `TileEnableBypass` parameter determines the read-after-write hazard latency within each memory tile of the RAM. When set to 1, it enables a bypass feature that allows the RAM to provide the most recent write data immediately if a read and write operation occur at the same address in the same cycle, resulting in zero-cycle latency for such scenarios. When set to 0, the RAM introduces a one-cycle latency for read-after-write hazards, meaning a read operation cannot access the newly written data until at least one cycle after the write operation. This parameter is crucial for optimizing performance based on specific application requirements, balancing between immediate data availability and potential timing constraints.|
|EnableMemReset|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `EnableMemReset` parameter determines whether the memory elements within the RAM are initialized to zero upon reset. When set to 1, the memory is cleared to zero during a reset, ensuring a known starting state. If set to 0, the memory contents remain undefined until they are explicitly written for the first time. This parameter allows users to control the initialization behavior of the RAM, which can be crucial for ensuring predictable operation in certain applications.|
|AddressWidth|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `AddressWidth` parameter determines the bit-width required to address the entire depth of the RAM. It is calculated as the ceiling of the base-2 logarithm of the `Depth` parameter, ensuring that all possible addresses within the RAM's depth can be uniquely represented. This parameter is crucial for defining the size of the address input signals (`wr_addr` and `rd_addr`) and ensures compatibility with the RAM's addressing scheme.|

### Basic Functionality
|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|No Operation|This operation occurs when neither a read nor a write is requested. The control signals involved are `wr_valid = 0` and `rd_addr_valid = 0`. In this scenario, the RAM does not perform any read or write actions, and the output signals remain unchanged. The timing for this operation is the same cycle, meaning there is no delay in the outcome.|
|Write Operation|This operation is aimed at writing data to the RAM. It is triggered when `wr_valid = 1` and `rd_addr_valid = 0`. The write address and data are provided through `wr_addr` and `wr_data`, respectively. The operation involves address decoding and potential pipelining stages, resulting in the outcome being updated after many cycles.|
|Read Operation|This operation is designed to read data from the RAM. It occurs when `wr_valid = 0` and `rd_addr_valid = 1`. The read address is specified by `rd_addr`, and the output signals `rd_data_valid` and `rd_data` are updated after the read operation completes. Due to address decoding and read data pipelining stages, the outcome is updated after many cycles.|
|Simultaneous Read and Write Operation|This operation allows for both reading from and writing to the RAM simultaneously. It is initiated when `wr_valid = 1` and `rd_addr_valid = 1`. The write address and data are provided through `wr_addr` and `wr_data`, while the read address is specified by `rd_addr`. The output signals `rd_data_valid` and `rd_data` are updated after the read operation completes. Due to the combined effects of address decoding and read data pipelining stages, the outcome is updated after many cycles.|

### End-to-End Functionality
|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Sequential Write and Read Operations|Operations: Perform a sequence of write operations followed by read operations. Control signals `wr_valid` and `rd_addr_valid` are used to initiate write and read operations, respectively. During the write phase, `wr_valid` is set to 1, and data is provided via `wr_data` at the address specified by `wr_addr`. After completing the write operations, `rd_addr_valid` is set to 1 to initiate read operations, with the read address specified by `rd_addr`. The read data is available on `rd_data` after the read operation completes, with `rd_data_valid` indicating the validity of the data. The operations are pipelined, with the outcome of each read operation being updated after a number of cycles determined by the parameters `AddressDepthStages`, `ReadDataDepthStages`, and `ReadDataWidthStages`.|
|Overlapping Write and Read Operations with Bypass|Operations: Perform write and read operations with overlapping addresses, utilizing the bypass feature. Control signals `wr_valid` and `rd_addr_valid` are both set to 1, with `wr_addr` and `rd_addr` set to the same value to test the bypass functionality. If `TileEnableBypass` is set to 1, the read operation can immediately access the newly written data, resulting in zero-cycle write-to-read latency. The read data is available on `rd_data` with `rd_data_valid` indicating its validity, reflecting the newly written data if bypass is enabled. The operations are executed with the read data being updated after the latency determined by the pipeline stages and bypass configuration.|

### Corner Case Functionality
|Condition|Expected Behavior|Handling Mechanism|
|---|---|---|
|`wr_valid` and `rd_addr_valid` are both asserted, and `wr_addr` equals `rd_addr` with TileEnableBypass = 1|After the read latency, `rd_data_valid` is asserted and `rd_data` equals the past value of `wr_data` from read latency cycles ago.|Zero-cycle read-after-write hazard latency|
|`wr_valid` and `rd_addr_valid` are both asserted, and `wr_addr` equals `rd_addr` with TileEnableBypass = 0|After the read latency, `rd_data_valid` is asserted and `rd_data` equals the value of the memory before the past value of `wr_data` from read latency cycles ago was written to it.|One-cycle read-after-write hazard latency|

### Error Scenarios
|Error Scenario|Detection Mechanism|System Response|Recovery Actions|
|---|---|---|---|
|Write Address Out of Range|The design includes assertions to check if `wr_addr` is within the valid range when `wr_valid` is high.|If `wr_valid` is high and `wr_addr` is out of range, the assertion will trigger, indicating an error.|The design does not specify automatic recovery actions for these scenarios.|
|Read Address Out of Range|The design includes assertions to check if `rd_addr` is within the valid range when `rd_addr_valid` is high.|If `rd_addr_valid` is high and `rd_addr` is out of range, the assertion will trigger, indicating an error.|The design does not specify automatic recovery actions for these scenarios.|
